## 🎯 The Challenge

Finding a productive place to study or work isn’t always easy. Libraries can feel strict, and cafés tend to be noisy. Many users waste time hopping between spots, unsure what each location offers.

---

## 🚧 Why It Matters

- 🔇 **Noise kills focus** – especially in public places  
- ⏳ **Wasted time** – searching for the right spot  
- 😤 **No clear info** – amenities and availability are unclear

- 🏠 **Space Types**: From quiet zones to group-friendly rooms  
- 📷 **Live Info**: Availability, features, photos, and details

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

## 🔍 Market Gap
